Learning and practice with ChiaLisp

## READ FIRST

This is not a tutorial, I am learning, I do not recommend trying to create these coins, unless it is in test environment, like Testnet 

### Mortgage Coin

Trying:

1. Allice is going to lend Bob X amount, but Bob will leave X amount of XCH in mortgage as guarantee of payment.

2. Allice cannot foreclose if the established time has not passed (TIME_TO_PAY)

3. Bob can make payments and the coin recreates itself.

4. If the same amount as the mortgage and payment (+ MORTGAGE_AMOUNT AMOUNT_TO_PAID) is deposited before the due date, the mortgage is returned and the fee payment is executed.

### loops

Trying:

1. Iterate lists
2. Recursion
